	<p>
	15-441 is an introductory course in computer networks. The emphasis
	will be on the basic performance and engineering tradeoffs in the
	design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues
	more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects
	requiring significant design and implementation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are
	and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they
	are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw
	examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include:
	congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming,
	multi-casting, switching, internetworking, and network
	security. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, the projects,
	and two mid-term exams.

	<p>
	Because this course has a big project component, you must be
	proficient in C programming on UNIX systems. It is required that you
	have taken 15-213 and gotten a &quot;C-&quot; or higher since many of
	the programming skills you will need are taught in that course.

    <h3 class="panel-title">Course Policies</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
	<h4>Collaboration</h4>
	
	<p>Students are encouraged to talk to each other, to the TAs, to the
	instructors, or to anyone else about any of the assignments. Any
	assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and
	sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write
	out his or her own solutions to the homework. </p>
	
	<p>The project handouts have more detailed information about collaboration when
	working on the projects, but, basically, each programming project group must
	write their own code and documentation for the programming projects done as a
	group.</p>
	
	<p>Consulting another student's or group's solution is prohibited and submitted
	solutions may not be copied from any source.  You may not supply work that you
	complete during 15-441 to other students in future instances of this course
	(just as you may not use work completed by students who've taken the course
	previously).  If you have any question about whether some activity would
	constitute cheating, please feel free to ask the instructors.</p>
	
	<h4>Late Policy</h4>
	
	<p>Take project and homework deadlines seriously. Our experience is that 
	students often seriously underestimate the effort involved in programming 
	assignments and projects. If we give you 4 weeks to complete an assignment, 
	there is typically a reason.  In the interest of fairness, we have adopted
	the following late policy:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Each student is given a total of 2 &quot;free points&quot; to use during the 
	  semester.</li>
	  <li>One free point can be used to extend the deadline of any homework 
	  assignment by a single day with no penalty.</li>
	  <li>Two free points are needed to extend the deadline of Projects I or
	  II by a single day with no penalty (you and your partner might each
	  contribute a point).</li>
	  <li>In the absence of free points, the deadline for any assignment 
	      can be extended with a 15% penalty per day.</li>
	  <li>No deadline can be extended by more than two days, regardless 
	   of how many free points you have saved up.  Assignments will <b>NOT</b> 
	   be accepted 48 hours after the due date.</li>
	
	  <li><i>If you are ill</i>: If you have a medical note, you may turn
	  in your assignments late without using free points.  Please contact
	  the instructors to arrange a reasonable replacement turn-in time.
	  <b>You must notify us before the due-date</b>.
	  Without a medical note, you must use your free points as you would
	  with any other reason for being late.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Re-Grading</h4>
	
	<p>If you think we made a mistake in grading, please return the
	assignment with a note explaining your concern to the course secretary
	no later than two weeks after the day the assignment was returned. We
	will have the question re-graded by the person responsible for grading
	that question.</p>
	
	<h4>Partner Problems</h4>
	
	<p>Please try to avoid having partner problems.  Seriously!  Share your hopes
	before they turn into concerns, your concerns before they are problems, and
	your problems before they inflate into crises.</p>
	
	<p>In order for the course staff to help you and your partner work through
	issues, or for us to provide an appropriate response to serious partner
	problems, you <i>must</i> contact us <i>well before</i> the relevant due date!
	A special case to avoid is coming to us a day or two before a major deadline to
	tell us that your partner has been ill (etc.) for multiple weeks.  We, and thus
	you, have many more options if you inform us <i>while</i> a problem is
	developing, instead of after the fact.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">
	<ul>
	<li>
	<span class=todo>
	<b>Class newsgroup</b>:  academic.cs.15-441<br />
	  If you have a question about a project handout or a technical
	issue, there is an excellent chance that other students have
	the same question.  Please read the newsgroup to see if there
	has been traffic, and consider posting your questions there.</li>

	<li><b>Staff mailing list:</b> <span class="email">staff-441 at cs dot cmu dot edu</span><br />
	  If you have a question you believe is particular to your circumstances
	and should not be posted in a public forum (e.g., one that involves
	posting the solution to homework problems), send mail to the staff list,
	which reaches the instructors and TAs.  Questions of general interest
	sent to the staff list will probably be replied to via the newsgroup.
	If your question involves a confidential personal or academic-conduct
	issue, you should probably contact one of the instructors in person
	or send mail to both.</li>
