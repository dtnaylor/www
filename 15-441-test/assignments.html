<div class=todo>
<p>There will be three programming projects and four written
homework assignments.</p>
<p>All homework and the first project is to be done individually.  The second
and third programming projects will be done in groups of two students; This is
for two reasons: the first is the size of the class. The second and more
important reason is that this is an opportunity to experience the joys and
frustrations of working with others. It's a skill you only get better at with
practice.</p>
</div>

<p>Since 15-441 fulfills the project-class requirement of the CS
degree, you will be expected to learn and practice good software
engineering, as well as demonstrate mastery of the networking
concepts. Both partners in a project group will need to fully
understand the project and your solution in order to do well on
those exam questions relating to the projects. For example, a
typical question might be: "When you implemented <i>X</i>, you
came across a particular situation <i>Y</i> that required some
care. Explain why this simple solution <i>Z</i> doesn't work and
describe how you solved it." We'll pick questions such that it
will take some effort to figure out <i>Y</i>. If you didn't take
the time to work the problem yourself and just relied on your
partner, you won't have enough time during the test to figure it
out. Be careful, the insights you'll need will come only from
actually <b>solving</b> the problem as opposed to just seeing the
solution.</p>

<div class=todo>
<p>By their nature, the assignments aren't going to be completely
comprehensive of everything you'll encounter in the real world
or in class.  To assist you, we've compiled a list of
<a href="study_problems.html">suggested study problems</a>
that you may want to do in addition to the normal homework.
They're not graded, but they'd make great topics to discuss
with the course staff during office hours.</p>

<h2>Notes on the 15-441 Programming Projects</h2>

<p>A key objective of 15-441 is to provide
a significant experience with system programming, where you must write
programs that are robust and that must integrate with a large, installed
software base.  Oftentimes, these programs are the ones that other
people will build upon or use as tools.  Systems programming is very
different from the application program development you have done in earlier
courses:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is typically done in a low-level language, such as C, to ensure
close control over system resources.</li>
<li>Especially with server code, it must be designed to run indefinitely.
It must handle reliably handle <i>every</i> possible error condition, and
it must manage resources such as memory with care.</li>
<li>It must be secure.  Connecting a system to a network makes it vulnerable
to malicious attacks initiated anywhere in the world.  Poorly designed
or implemented network software provides a common entrypoint for attack.
System software must be invulnerable to flaws such as string overflows
or malformed incoming messages.  (This point bears repeating:  Any
system software must stringently check input it receives from the
network or from the user.  Do not trust either one!  They're often
out to get you.)</li>
<li>The interfaces to other parts of the system are generally specified
by documented protocols.</li>
<li>Networking software typically involves concurrency, both within individual
machines (multiple processes or threads) as well as among the different
network components.</li>
<li>An important part of system programming is to develop comprehensive
test methods for the programs.  A significant effort should be invested
in writing programs that will thoroughly test the system code, including
the handling of different error conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, please note that, by design, the 15-441 projects do not always
specify every corner case bit of behavior or every design decision you may have
to make.  A major challenge in implementing real systems is in making the leap
from a specification that is often somewhat incomplete (e.g., the IRC spec) to
a real-world implementation.  Don't get frustrated --- our grading will not
dock you for making reasonable design decisions!  We suggest three general
guidelines to follow: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
others.</i> This is the design guideline underlying many Internet services,
first uttered as a robustness principle by Jon Postel in the <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">first TCP RFC, RFC 793</a>.

<li><i class=todo>Browse the newsgroup and FAQ, ask the course staff!</i>

<li><i>Make a reasonable design decision and document it.</i> In a
perfect world, all aspects of a design would be comletely specified,
but most real-world, large, complex systems do not achieve this goal.
You will often hear the course staff reply: <i>You may pick either
alternative as long as your server does not crash.</i> This advice
applies particularly to error handling, where there are a nearly
infinite number of possible errors with partially-specified error
responses.  The goal of the course is to gain experience with creating
large systems; we don't expect students to be psychic but rather to
exercise good judgement about creating a robust and usable system.
</ul>

<p>We'll go into more detail about each of these points during the
recitation sections.  But keep in mind:  the programming assignments
in 15-441 are larger and more open-ended than in other courses.
Doing a good job on the project requires more than just producing
code that runs:  it should have a good overall organization, be
well implemented and documented, and be thoroughly tested.
