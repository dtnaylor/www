<h1>15-441 IRC Server FAQ</h1>


<h2>General programming questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Should we treat metric prefixes such as kilo as being 1000x or as 1024x? Should we treat kilobytes differently from kilobits?
<br /><ul>
	<li>1 Kbit/s = 1000 bits/s</li>
	<li>1 Kbyte/s = 1000 bytes/s = 8000 bits / s</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you're expressing things in bits/s or bytes/s please use 1000.  
If you're expressing the <i>size</i> of a file, please use 1024 bytes.
A general approach is to refer to network speeds in bits/sec ("100 megabits/sec") and to
refer to file sizes in bytes ("a 10 gigabyte file"), to help emphasize that one is
using the networking convention and the other the 1024 convention.
</p>

<p>
An alternative option, which you are welcome to use (and, in fact,
encouraged), is to
refer to the file sizes using the binary prefixes "kibi" (Ki), "mebi" (Mi),
"gibi" (Gi), and so on.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix">Wikipedia
has a nice article about the SI prefixes in computing.</a>  They are now an
official IEEE standard, and it would be really great if their use took off.
</p>
</li>
<li>What are the flags that can and should be used with gcc?
<br />
As you probably know from 213: -W is the warning level, -O is the
optimization level, and -g is the debugging tables.  -g produces a
much bigger file.  In fact, you probably want to strip the debugging
information out before giving it to the public.  As for optimizations,
you probably will not gain much performance from -O2.  You will be
making many, many system calls, and system calls are slow anyway
you look at them.  No amount of optimization is going to speed those
up.  While developing:
<ul>
  <li>Use <tt>-Wall</tt> to enable all compiler warnings!</li>
  <li>Use -g and -O0 to make the binary easier to debug.<br />
      Enabling optimization can change the flow of control in your
program, making things like backtraces look confusing or not happen at all.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="timers"></a>Is there some place to get some pointers to implementing timers in C?
<br />
The <tt>select()</tt> call has a timeout parameter. If you maintain
a variable containing the global time at which you need to wakeup
and broadcast a packet, it's easy to calculate the difference
between the current time and the "wakeup time," and pass that 
as the timeout to select. Then, when select returns, you can check
to see if the current time is later than the wakeup time, and if
so, do whatever it is that you needed to so.
</li>
<li>Is there not some required library we should tell gcc to use while linking so that select can manage time?
<br />
The headers you need for select are outlined in the manual.  Try
"man select" and you will find everything you need.  Note that when
using a timeout in select, Linux will change the time structure
to reflect the remaining amount of time.  For example, I tell select
to timeout after 60 seconds, but select returns after 40 seconds.
The time structure I handed it will now read 20 seconds.
<b>This behavior is system-dependant and your code should not rely on it</b>.
To ensure portability, you should check the current time using <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>
and then, as the manual page suggests, reset the time structure before each call.

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Socket programming questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>
When one of the clients disconnects, we get a broken pipe error.
For some reason <tt>select()</tt> puts the disconnected fd in the
set of readfds and writefds. Is there a way of detecting when a
client has disconnected?

<br />
See the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/socket/">UNIX Socket FAQ</a> for more information.

<p>
There are two errors of interest: EPIPE and ECONNRESET.  When a
client disconnects, your program will get a SIGPIPE and errno will
be set to EPIPE. Signals have default handlers unless you specify
your own.  SIGPIPE will simply exit, an undesirable feature.  I
suggest ignoring SIGPIPE:
</p>

<p><tt>signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);   /* Block SIGPIPE Signals */</tt></p>

<p>
This will prevent your server from dying, but <tt>select()</tt> will still mark the
fd as readable/writable (section 2.22 of the above link).
</p>

<p>
If <tt>read()</tt> returns -1 and sets errno to ECONNRESET ("Connection reset
by peer"), you should remove the client.  The other case of <tt>read()</tt>
is EOF (ie 0), which also means the connection is closed, and you
should remove the client.  But remember that for robustness, your server
should gracefully handle any failure returned by read.
</p>

<p>
If <tt>send()</tt> or <tt>write()</tt> returns -1 and sets errno
to EPIPE, then you should remove the client.
</p>

</li>
<li>Can we assume that the functions <tt>rt_recvfrom</tt> and <tt>rt_sendto</tt> that are provided are non-blocking?

<br />The basic answer is that these functions are simply wrappers around
the real <tt>recvfrom</tt> and <tt>sendto</tt> functions, so they
will behave the same way the normal functions will.  Ergo:
<p>
You can assume that <tt>rt_sendto</tt> is non-blocking, because it's UDP.
If a UDP socket is over-full, it just starts dropping packets.
So it may fail, but it shouldn't block.  That said, if you already
have code that handles a buffered socket for writing stuff, you're
welcome to reuse it - it will just never block.
</p>

<p>You may not assume that <tt>rt_recvfrom</tt> is non-blocking.  It will block
if there are no packets waiting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
In the write-up, it states that we need to convert any multi-byte integer field to network byte order.  Are we suppose to convert the user entries and channel entries to network byte order too?  Is there a function that does this for char *?

<br /><ul>
<li>All integers should be network byte order.<br />
Use ntohl() and htonl() to convert between the two.</li>
<li>Characters are assumed to be sent in ascii and do not need converted.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:<br />
<ul>
<li>Assume type, nodeID, seqnum are unsigned longs in host order</li>
<li>Assume packet is a malloc'ed char array, and nick is 16 chars long.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: This is only to give you the idea of how to do it!)</p>
<pre>
   ... somewhere earlier, you defined a struct with the packet contents ...
   struct foo {
     u_int32_t type;
     u_int32_t last_node_id;
     u_int32_t seqnum;
     char nick[16];
     ...
   }

   /* Convert host to network */
    /* packet is a char * pointing to space for the packet */
    struct foo *p;

    p = (struct foo *)packet;

    p->type   = htonl( type );
    p->last_node_id = htonl(last_node_id);
    p->seqnum = htonl( seqnum );

    strncpy(p->nick, nick,  16);
</pre>


<p>To unmarshal the messages at the receiver:</p>
<pre>
    type = ntohl(p->type);
    last_node_id = ntohl(p->last_node_id);
    seqnum = ntohl(p->seqnum);
    strncpy(nick, p->nick, 16);
</pre>

</li>
<li>What is the first parameter, <tt>int s</tt>, in <tt>sendto</tt>?

<br />It is the file descriptor (fd) of the server's connection.
</li>

<li>Why does <tt>sendto()</tt> require the <tt>sockaddr</tt> struct, when <tt>send()</tt> doesn't?
<br />Send operates on a connection, meaning the socket already knows where the data is
headed.  Before calling <tt>send</tt>, you must have already called <tt>connect</tt>.
</li>
<li>
We're a little confused about the C time structures.  The <tt>select()</tt>
man page is a bit confusing about what is in a "timeval."
How do we use these?

<br />Select takes a <tt>struct timeval</tt>.  This struct has two members:
<ul>
<li><tt>tv_sec</tt> - the number of seconds</li>
<li><tt>tv_usec</tt> - the number of microseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just set the timeval.tv_sec and timeval.tv_usec before calling select.  You should not
rely on the values in this structure <i>after</i> calling select (see <a href="#timers">earlier
question about timers</a>).
We suggest something like:
</p>

<pre>
  struct timeval tv_start, tv_end;

  gettimeofday(&tv_start);
  select(...);
  gettimeofday(&tv_end);

  and then, if you need

  time_waited = tv_difference(&tv_start, &tv_end);
</pre>
<p>
  (tv_difference is a function you have to write, but it's trivial).
</p>
</li>
<li>When we start the server, it tries to connect to its neighbors.  If the
other servers haven't started yet (or won't exist), doesn't this connection
attempt block?  If so, how do we prevent this from making our server block,
or do we need to?
<br />Yes, you need to.  Set the file descriptor to non-blocking before you attempt
to connect.  <tt>connect()</tt> will return immediately with a return value of -1,
and will set <tt>errno</tt> to EINPROGRESS.  After that, you can <tt>select()</tt>
on the socket to make sure that you only operate on it after the TCP connection
has completed.  (Or you'll get an error if the connection fails).
<p>
See the man page for <tt>connect</tt> for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When we reply with multiple lines, should we use multiple write(...)
calls or one write call with \n's?  Will the grading scripts accept
either?

<br />
Recall that TCP is a stream oriented protocol and it could "repackage"
the write calls you perform arbitrarily into packets. in arbitrary
ways. The read calls performed at the other end
may return data that is not split up in the same way as the write
calls. Therefore, this means that there is no functional difference
between using multiple write calls or one write call. The grading
scripts must accept either.  Note also that your server should not
depend on TCP behaving in such a manner when reading or writing: the
grading scripts may try to do devious things to cause read() to return
smaller or large amounts of data, etc.

<p>
Note that the above is not true for UDP. UDP sends provide strict message boundaries. What you send in one sendto call is exactly what you receive at the other end in a single recvfrom call.
